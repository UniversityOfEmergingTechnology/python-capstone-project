BGM stands for Background Music, which refers to a type of music that is used to enhance the atmosphere or mood of a particular setting, event, or media production. It is often played subtly in the background, supporting and complementing the main audio or visual content without overpowering it. BGM can be found in various media forms, such as movies, TV shows, commercials, video games, and even in public spaces like restaurants or retail stores. With artificial intelligence, BGM can be intelligently selected, generated, or adapted based on the specific context, preferences, or objectives, providing personalized and seamless audio experiences. AI algorithms can analyze the content, emotions, or audience response to optimize the choice and arrangement of background music for different purposes.
